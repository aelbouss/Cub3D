💯 Great question — and honestly, **Cub3D is one of the few 42 projects where splitting work smartly can save you a *lot* of time** ⏱️ — **but only if you do it correctly.**

Below I’ll give you the **best possible split** (based on experience from many teams 🧠), explain **why it works**, and how you should collaborate so you **don’t block each other.**

---

## 🧠 Golden Rule Before Splitting

You **must agree together** on:

* 🗂️ A **shared header file** with all `struct`s and global types
* 📦 A **shared folder structure** and file naming convention
* 📑 A “contract” of which function does what and how it’s called

If you don’t do that first, you’ll waste days merging and debugging 🫠

## ✅ Best Split Strategy for Cub3D (2 people)

Here’s the most efficient division 👇

---

### 👤 Person A — **Parsing & Game Logic (Backend)**

🧰 Skills: strong parsing, error handling, memory management

**Tasks:**

1. 📄 **Parsing `.cub` file**

   * Read and validate texture paths
   * Parse floor/ceiling colors
   * Parse the map grid
2. 🧱 **Map validation**

   * Ensure map is closed
   * Check player position
   * Validate allowed characters
3. 🧠 **Game data structures**

   * Create and initialize `t_config`, `t_map`, `t_game` structs
   * Implement clean `free_all()` and `error_exit()`
4. 🚪 **Map/Player initialization**

   * Set starting position and direction based on N/S/E/W
5. 🧪 **Testing & Debugging tools**

   * Write small functions to print map, check memory leaks

📁 Files example:

```
src/parsing/
  parse_file.c
  parse_map.c
  validate_map.c
  config.c
src/utils/
  errors.c
  free.c
```

✅ **Output:**

* A fully validated `t_game` object
* Ready-to-use `map`, `player`, and `textures` info

---

### 👤 Person B — **Raycasting & Rendering (Frontend)**

🧰 Skills: graphics, math, MiniLibX, performance

**Tasks:**

1. 🎮 **Game loop setup**

   * `mlx_init`, `mlx_new_window`, `mlx_loop`, hooks
2. 🧠 **Raycasting engine**

   * Implement DDA algorithm
   * Calculate wall distance & height
   * Project vertical lines
3. 🖼️ **Texture rendering**

   * Load textures (from A’s parsed data)
   * Map pixels correctly per column
4. 🏃 **Player movement**

   * WASD + rotation
   * Collision detection
5. 🧩 **Optional**: minimap, doors, mouse rotation

📁 Files example:

```
src/raycasting/
  raycasting.c
  dda.c
  render_walls.c
  textures.c
src/player/
  move.c
  rotate.c
```

✅ **Output:**

* A running 3D engine that uses the data provided by A
* Smooth rendering, movement, and interaction

## 🔄 How to Collaborate Without Blocking

Here’s the secret sauce 👇

### 📆 Phase 1 — Agreement (Days 1–2)

Both:

* Decide on structures (e.g. `t_game`, `t_player`, `t_config`)
* Define function prototypes and headers
* Create `.h` file together

### 📂 Phase 2 — Work Independently (Days 3–20)

* **A**: Works only in `src/parsing/`
* **B**: Works only in `src/raycasting/`
* Use dummy test data (e.g. hardcode a map) to let B test rendering even before A finishes.

### 🔗 Phase 3 — Integration (Days 21–25)

* Merge both parts
* Replace dummy data with real parsed data
* Debug issues together

### 🧪 Phase 4 — Bonus & Polish (Days 26–40)

* Split again: one does bonus, one does polishing/tests.

---

## 📊 Advantages of This Split

✅ **Faster progress:** Both of you work at the same time.
✅ **Cleaner code:** One is focused on parsing & validation, the other on rendering & math.
✅ **Easy debugging:** Bugs are isolated by domain.
✅ **Scalability:** Adding bonus features later is much easier.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Not agreeing on structures → causes massive merge conflicts.
❌ One person depending too early on the other’s code → delays progress.
✅ Solution: create temporary dummy data or placeholder structs to allow parallel work.

---

## 📁 Example `t_game` Structure (Agreed by Both)

```c
typedef struct s_player {
    double x;
    double y;
    double dir_x;
    double dir_y;
    double plane_x;
    double plane_y;
} t_player;

typedef struct s_config {
    char *no_path;
    char *so_path;
    char *we_path;
    char *ea_path;
    int floor_color;
    int ceiling_color;
} t_config;

typedef struct s_map {
    char **grid;
    int width;
    int height;
} t_map;

typedef struct s_game {
    t_config config;
    t_map map;
    t_player player;
    void *mlx;
    void *win;
} t_game;
```

This header is the “contract” between you two — once this is decided, you can work separately 💪

---

### 📌 Recommended Strategy

If you want **maximum speed and minimal pain**, do this:

* **You**: Parsing, validation, and initialization (Person A)
* **Your teammate**: Raycasting and rendering engine (Person B)

Then both join forces for polishing and bonus 🚀

Would you like me to make a **day-by-day schedule** (40 days) based on this “split work” plan too 📆? (It’ll show exactly what each of you should do each day.)
👉 This is super useful to stay on track and finish on time.
